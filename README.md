# JavaScript Fundamentals Lab

The purpose of this repository is to manipulate data that is given as inputs and output them in a certain way and format. 

## Description

Through this lab I was able to put in practice my skills in JavaScript using arrays, objects, functions, while loops, for loops, and implement error handling. The inputs were data about homework assignments and I had to output the average of the student, the student id, the assignments that were due and calculate any assignments that were late for a certain amount of deducted points.
